            "SwiftUI and Storyboard are both tools used for creating user interfaces in iOS apps, but they differ in their approach and functionality. SwiftUI, introduced by Apple in 2019, employs a declarative syntax, allowing developers to describe the desired UI and letting SwiftUI handle the implementation details. It supports live previews, making it easy to visualize changes in real-time. On the other hand, Storyboard is a visual interface builder where developers design UIs by dragging and dropping components onto a canvas. While Storyboard has been a conventional choice for iOS UI development, SwiftUI's modern approach and live preview capabilities have made it increasingly popular among developers.",
